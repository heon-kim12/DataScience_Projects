## Projects
1. Sentimental Analysis - using LSTM model on NAVER movie reviews
- Description: This project involves sentiment analysis on NAVER movie reviews using LSTM models.
- Skills Used: The approach includes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for analyzing the sentiment of the movie reviews. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras libraries. Preprocessing steps like tokenization and padding are applied to the text data. 
- Results: The LSTM model showed promising results with an accuracy of 67% in the validation dataset. The model was trained on a split of 80% training and 20% validation data, with early stopping implemented to prevent overfitting. Despite the limited dataset of 500 sentences, the model demonstrated its potential in sentiment analysis of Korean movie reviews, indicating positive sentiment for the sample text review. The use of LSTM allowed for better handling of sequential data, contributing to the model's effectiveness in understanding the context and sentiment of the reviews.
